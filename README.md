# Cynthia Ugwu Portfolio

## ðŸ“¸ Glimpses of the Cynthia Ugwu Portfolio Clone

## ðŸŒŸ Project Overview:

Cynthia Ugwu's portfolio (https://cynthiaugwu.com/) is an Awwwards-winning website celebrated for its concise, well-structured design and innovative mouse hover effects for featured projects. Inspired by these features, I undertook the challenge to recreate this frontend project. The goal was to capture its simplicity, well-structured interface, and compelling visual effects, including the unique cursor interactions.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

- HTML: Used for structuring the site.
- CSS: Employed for design, including micro-animations and responsive layouts.
- JavaScript and Libraries:
  - GSAP: Utilized for major animations.
  - Locomotive Scroll: Implemented for smooth scrolling and precise control over scroll speed, including managing scroll speed of image elements.
  - ScrollTrigger: Integrated for custom scroll-based animations.
    
##  ðŸ“š Learning Experience:

This project provided a valuable opportunity to delve deeper into creating a progress bar type loader and developing the mouse hover project preview effect. Additionally, I learned more about Locomotive Scroll and how to use it to dynamically control scroll speed across various elements. Creating the custom cursor, which changes size and speed based on scroll interaction, further enhanced the site's fluidity and user experience. Overall, this project significantly advanced my frontend development and animation skills.

## ðŸ’¬ Invitation for Feedback:
